# JonFastFox
This is a fork of LibreWolf which is a fork of Firefox. This browser disables a few things and enables a few things to make the browser generally faster. It's not perfection, but it's what I could do to make Firefox as fast as possible.

This software is only compatible with Windows, I didn't want to make one for other operating systems, sorry if you are a Linux user and wanted this. It might happen if it's requested enough.
